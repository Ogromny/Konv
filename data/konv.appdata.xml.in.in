    <_p>
      Konv.im is an open-source, libre and secure instant messaging application that
      aims to replace Skype, Whatsapp, and other proprietary services. I believe that
      bringing a free (as in freedom, aswell as in price) software that enable
      individuals to communicate freely, without the fear to be censored or sued, is
      primordial in this post-Snowden era. Free speech enables **real** sharing of
      ideas, concepts, researchs, etc. That's how I want to contribute saving what
      stays of people liberties and rights.
